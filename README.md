# Cheat sheet for ggmap
This project is for community contribution assignment for EDAV class.

As my community contribution for the EDAV class, I created a cheat sheet about the geographic visualization by using ggmap.

The link for the cheat sheet is [here](https://github.com/Yuta555/ggmap_cheatsheet/blob/main/ggmap_cheatsheet.pdf).


We sometimes want to describe a fact using geographic visualization. For example, if I’m looking for the shortest path from Columbia University to Central Park, I would like to see a route with a background of road map in which I can understand which street I should walk. However, it seems to be difficult to create a route map or other geographic visualizations by only the original ggplot2 packages, as far as I know.

An R package, “ggmap”, makes it easy to download and choose various kinds of map tiles such as the Google Maps and Stamen Maps. In addition, you might feel it is easy to plot data since you can deal with the ggplot2 framework you are familiar with.

That’s why I’m eager to learn how to use the ggmap package and create the cheat sheet for everyone.

What to submit
1. In most cases you should have something tangible to upload, such as the tutorial, cheatsheet, etc.  Alternatively you may submit a link to material online (YouTube video, etc.) If there's nothing tangible then include a longer description (see 2.).

2. An explanation of the motivation for the project, the need it addresses, and your own evaluation of the project including what you learned / what you might do differently next time. (1/2 page)
